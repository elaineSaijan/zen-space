# zen-space

### ðŸŒŸ Objective
Zen-Space was built as a creative side project to explore conversational AI and mental wellness. The goal is to create a judgment-free, digital space where users can express themselves and chat with a Gen Z-styled virtual therapist. This app provides an outlet to vent and reflectâ€”but itâ€™s not a substitute for real mental health care.

ðŸ§  Disclaimer: This app is not a licensed mental health tool. The AI responses should not be taken as serious advice. Please seek professional help if you are struggling. This is just a safe space to vent.
